# Advent of Code
Every language is a separate project. Any year, day and part can be run with command line arguments.

For example, to run the Rust 2023 day 1 part 1 solution, do `cd rust; cargo run -- -y 2023 -d 1 -p 1`.

To run the Elixir 2024 day 1 part 1 solution, do `cd elixir; mix aoc.run -y 2024 -d 1 -p 1`.

# Input files
Input `*.txt` files are excluded because the creator of Advent of Code has requested not to include them.

Instead, follow the examples for each language for including input files.
